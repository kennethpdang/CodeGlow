# CodeGlow
This is a Google Chrome extension that syntax highlights a block of text between a group of delimiters given primarily by the characters `<pre>` and `</pre>`. The purpose of this code is to address the need for an extension
that doesn't appear to exists, which can style textual characters similar to how the "Tex All The Things" Extension can render LaTeX scripst between the delimiters `$` and `$`.

## How Does it Work?
This code uses the Chrome Extensions API which are given here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/.
